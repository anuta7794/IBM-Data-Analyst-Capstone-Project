# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

## Overview:

This capstone project, part of the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate** course, demonstrates proficiency in data analysis tools and techniques, including **_Excel_**, **_Python_**, **_SQL_**, and **_Looker Studio_**. The project involves tasks such as data collection, wrangling, exploratory analysis, statistical analysis, data visualization, and creating interactive dashboards. 

## Scenario:

I have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting firm renowned for its expertise in IT solutions and highly experienced consultants. To stay competitive in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, my organization regularly analyzes data to identify emerging and future skill requirements. As a Data Analyst, you wll contribute to this initiative by collecting data from diverse sources and identifying trends for this year's report on in-demand skills. 

## Dataset:

One key source for this project is the latest **Stack Overflow Developer Survey**, a comprehensive dataset offering insights into the global developer community. It consists of responses from developers with different professional backgrounds, educational levels and geographic locations. The dataset is available at [link](https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/08/06/2024-developer-survey/).

## Steps:

### 1. Collecting Data Using APIs.

I began by analyzing HTTP requests and utilizing the GitHub REST API to retrieve and paginate job postings for various technologies. Next, I collected job data from the GitHub Jobs API.

### 2. Collecting Data Using Webscraping.

In this section, I employed web scraping techniques to collect data by downloading webpages, extracting links and images, and parsing HTML tables, subsequently saving the data into a CSV file.

### 3. Exploring Data.

After collecting sufficient data, I analyzed it to summarize key dataset characteristics and identify common data types used in data analysis.

### 4. Data Wrangling.

In this module, I applied essential data-wrangling techniques to clean and prepare datasets for analysis, including:

- Identifying and handling missing values;

- Removing duplicate entries;

- Imputing missing data;

- Normalizing data.

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis.

In this module, I applied essential exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to extract meaningful insights from the dataset:
  
- Data distribution analysis;

- Outlier detection and removal;

- Correlation exploration;

- DataFrame creation.

### 6. Data Vizualization.

Next, I applied essential data visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights from the Stack Overflow survey dataset:

- Visualizing data distribution: utilized **_histograms_** and **_box plots_** to understand the spread and central tendency of various features;

- Exploring feature relationships: employed **_scatter_** and **_bubble plots_** to examine potential correlations between different variables;

- Analyzing data composition: created **_pie charts_** and **_stacked charts_** to assess the proportional makeup of categorical data;

- Comparing categorical data: used **_line_** and **_bar charts_** to compare metrics across different categories effectively.

### 7. Building a Dashboard.
